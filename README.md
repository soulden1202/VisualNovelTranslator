# Intro
With LLM getting cheaper than ever using them to translate readable Visual Novel won't make us totally broke anymore. With Gemini you can have up to 1m free tokens and then pay as you go or you can just create new account and get a new API key.
Anyway this just a simple application I use to read untranslated visual novel because god forbid I can't learn Japanese. So far it pretty readable


# Python
To use this you first you need python installed, you can find installtion guide here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

#Textactor
After that you need to have a texthooker like Textractor:
https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor


#Steps
Install all libraries needed: Gemini, PyQt6, openai, pyperclip etc...

Get api key from Gemini or Deepseek:

https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing
https://api-docs.deepseek.com

Then parse the key into .env

First start your game then hook it with texttractor and then start the program.
